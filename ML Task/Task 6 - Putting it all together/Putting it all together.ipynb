    "At this point we are at the end of supervised machine learning part of the course. So in this i will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This mini-project is open-ended, and while working on it, there might be some situations where i'll have to use my own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure i have to explain my decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have my final code. That said, my code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, i should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in my code. \n",
    "3. If i realize that i am repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of my code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. I may use code from previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "4. If you are having trouble running models on your laptop because of the size of the dataset, you can create your train/test split in such a way that you have less data in the train split. If i end up doing this, please write a note to the grader in the submission explaining why you are doing it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "I am plan to grade fairly and leniently. i don't have some secret target score that i need to achieve to get a good grade. **I'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if i just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If i do a bunch of sane things and get a lower accuracy than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to me to decide when i am \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. "

    "## Understanding the problem <a name=\"1\"></a>\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mini project, i will be working on a classification problem of predicting whether a credit card client will default or not. \n",
    "For this problem, i will use [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). In this data set, there are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled \"default.payment.next.month\" in the data. The rest of the columns can be used as features. I may take some ideas and compare your results with [the associated research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719), which is available through [the UBC library](https://www.library.ubc.ca/). \n",
    "\n",
    "**tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spend some time understanding the problem and what each feature means.I can find this information in the documentation on [the dataset page on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). Writing a few sentences on my initial thoughts on the problem and the dataset. \n",
    "2. Download the dataset and read it as a pandas dataframe. "
